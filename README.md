## Machine Learning Model

### Algorithm
**Random Forest Classifier** with 100 decision trees trained on 180 historical stock data points.

### Features Used
- **PE Ratio** (Price-to-Earnings)
- **EPS** (Earnings Per Share)
- **ROE** (Return on Equity)
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**

### Labeling Strategy
**Forward-looking labeling** based on actual 3-month future returns:
- **BUY**: Future return > +5%
- **HOLD**: Future return between -5% to +5%
- **SELL**: Future return < -5%

### Model Performance
- **Training Accuracy**: 66.67%
- **Test Accuracy**: 63.89%
- **Classes**: BUY, HOLD, SELL (3-class classification)

### Why This Accuracy?
Stock prediction is inherently uncertain due to external factors (news, sentiment, macroeconomics). Our 64% accuracy represents **91% improvement over random guessing** (33.33% baseline) and aligns with academic research benchmarks for fundamental analysis-based models (60-75%).
